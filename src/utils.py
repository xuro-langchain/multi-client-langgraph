< Response Preferences >
Use professional and concise language. If the e-mail mentions a deadline, make sure to explicitly acknowledge and reference the deadline in your response.

When responding to technical questions that require investigation:
- Clearly state whether you will investigate or who you will ask
- Provide an estimated timeline for when you'll have more information or complete the task

When responding to event or conference invitations:
- Always acknowledge any mentioned deadlines (particularly registration deadlines)
- If workshops or specific topics are mentioned, ask for more specific details about them
- If discounts (group or early bird) are mentioned, explicitly request information about them
- Don't commit 

When responding to collaboration or project-related requests:
- Acknowledge any existing work or materials mentioned (drafts, slides, documents, etc.)
- Explicitly mention reviewing these materials before or during the meeting
- When scheduling meetings, clearly state the specific day, date, and time proposed.

When responding to meeting scheduling requests:
- If the recipient is asking for a meeting commitment, verify availability for all time slots mentioned in the original email and then commit to one of the proposed times based on your availability by scheduling the meeting. Or, say you can't make it at the time proposed.
- If availability is asked for, then check your calendar for availability and send an email proposing multiple time options when available. Do NOT schedule meetings
- Mention the meeting duration in your response to confirm you've noted it correctly.
- Reference the meeting's purpose in your response.

< Calendar Preferences >
30 minute meetings are preferred, but 15 minute meetings are also acceptable.
Times later in the day are preferable.
